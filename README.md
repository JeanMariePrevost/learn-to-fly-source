# Learn to Fly: source code

The ActionScript 2 code of Learn to Fly (2009), from version 3.54, the last build made in 2017.

This is for reading, not building. The game lived inside a Flash project file, with its code spread over the frames of its timelines, and the art and sound aren't included.

## What's here

`scripts/` holds code exported from the Flash project file:

1. `Main timeline.as`: the code on the game's main timeline, which is most of the game.
2. `Library/`: one file per library symbol that has code, in the same folders as the project's library.

Each block starts with a comment saying where it sits, for example `// ---- layer "Control", frame 4 ("init")`, or the instance it's attached to for `on (...)` and `onClipEvent (...)` code.
